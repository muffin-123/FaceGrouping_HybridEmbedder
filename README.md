This notebook groups photos by person using an **ensemble of pretrained face models** (ArcFace, FaceNet, SFace, VGG-Face), **MTCNN alignment**, and **DBSCAN** clustering over a cosine distance matrix. Itâ€™s order-independent, robust to pose/lighting, and easy to tune.

## âœ¨ Features
- Face detection & alignment: **MTCNN**
- Hybrid embeddings: **ArcFace + FaceNet + SFace + VGG-Face** (normalized & concatenated)
- Clustering: **DBSCAN** on cosine distance matrix
- Visualization of grouped results
- Colab-ready with GPU support

## ðŸ›  Requirements
See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). 


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

This project was tested on the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset.

- ðŸ“¥ Download (aligned/funneled version):  
  [LFW Deepfunneled (UMass)](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-deepfunneled.tgz)



- ðŸ“Œ To run experiments:
1. Pick a few subfolders (different people).
2. Copy their images into a flat folder (`/content/images_concat_aligned`).
3. Run the notebook â†’ embeddings are generated and grouped automatically.


### ðŸ”§ Custom Datasets
You can also use **your own dataset**:
- Place images in subfolders (one folder per person), or in a single folder with mixed people.
- Update the dataset path in the notebook:
```python
input_root = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/testDataset"
